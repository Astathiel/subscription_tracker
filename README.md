# Subscription Tracker

A full-stack serverless application designed to track monthly recurring expenses. This project demonstrates a complete integration of a React frontend with a Supabase backend, implementing authentication, database management, and payment processing.

## Live Demo

https://subscription-tracker-ashen.vercel.app/

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login using email via Supabase Auth.
* **Subscription Management:** Users can add, view, and track their monthly subscriptions.
* **Real-Time Database:** Data is stored in PostgreSQL and synced in real-time to the client.
* **Data Security:** Implementation of Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data.
* **Cost Calculation:** Automatic calculation of total monthly expenses.
* **Payment Simulation:** Integration with Stripe (Test Mode) to simulate a premium account upgrade flow.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, Vite, CSS3
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge API)
* **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
* **Payments:** Stripe
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* A Supabase account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/subscription-tracker.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/subscription-tracker.git)
    cd subscription-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory. Add your Supabase credentials:

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    ```

4.  **Database Setup**
    Run the following SQL query in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the necessary table and security policies:

    ```sql
    create table subscriptions (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
      name text not null,
      price numeric not null,
      renewal_date date not null,
      user_id uuid references auth.users not null
    );

    alter table subscriptions enable row level security;

    create policy "Users can view their own subscriptions"
    on subscriptions for select
    using ( auth.uid() = user_id );

    create policy "Users can insert their own subscriptions"
    on subscriptions for insert
    with check ( auth.uid() = user_id );
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  Add the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the Vercel Environment Variables settings.
4.  Deploy.

## Future Improvements

* Edit and Delete functionality for existing subscriptions.
* Data visualization for spending breakdown by category.
* Email notifications for upcoming renewal dates.
